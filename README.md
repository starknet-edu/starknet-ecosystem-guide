## Introduction to Starknet

Starknet is a decentralized Layer-2 network that boosts Ethereum's efficiency with faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions using zk-STARKs technology. Positioned as an enhancing layer atop Ethereum, it focuses on speed and cost, bridging scalability with widespread consensus. Starknet employs a mathematical framework to ensure network integrity, utilizing succinct, transparent proofs of computational integrity. This method allows for expanded capacity while making it possible for anyone to verify the network's integrity using accessible tools.

### Starknet’s Mission and Values

**Starknet’s mission** is to empower individuals to freely implement and use any social function they desire, underpinning a commitment to innovation, freedom, and autonomy within the digital space.

**Starknet’s values**, as outlined by Eli Ben-Sasson, Bareli, Brandt, Volokh in 2023, are deeply rooted in principles of lasting broadness, neutrality, and individual empowerment:

- **Lasting Broadness:** Starknet continuously works against power consolidation, emphasizing broad power distribution, open and transparent protocol and governance, and an inclusive governance structure that evolves to ensure long-term inclusivity.
- **Neutrality:** Starknet remains impartial, supporting a wide array of societal functions without bias towards the nature or purpose of the transactions it facilitates.
- **Individual Empowerment:** The network thrives on fostering an informed and autonomous user base, emphasizing the importance of education and community engagement as core to its mission and values.
